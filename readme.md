<!--Hook: Raise your hand if you're ready to get back to the front end.  So today, we're going to dive back into the front end in a big way.  The goal is two-fold, we want to save you time by intoducing a framework that makes dynamic HTML much easier.  The second part of the goal is to introduce you to the concept that there are tons of these frameworks, and they can all make your lives easier. -->

# Angular

### Why is this important?
<!-- framing the "why" in big-picture/real world examplnges -->
*This workshop is important because:*

Angular extends HTML with its declarative syntax to create dynamic, client-side web applications.

### What are the objectives?
<!-- specific/measurable goal for students to achieve -->
*After this workshop, developers will be able to:*

* **Use** Bower to require Angular 
* **Initialize** Angular in an HTML view to write expressions
* **Organize** your code with controllers, passing data to the view
* **Leverage** built-in filters & directives
* **Implement** two-way data binding

### Where should we be now?
<!-- call out the skills that are prerequisites -->
*Before this workshop, developers should already be able to:*

* **Create** dynamic, client-side web applications *without* a framework

## A Little Background

**AngularJS** is a Javascript-based, open-source, front-end framework maintained by Google and a community of individuals and corporations.  It was first released in 2010, and is currently going through a major transition from Angular 1.x to Angular 2.x.

## Weekend Reading Highlights

[Angular Guide Introduction](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/introduction)

<!-- Whip-around what is Angular? -->

* A "framework for dynamic web apps"
* "Lets you use HTML as your template language"
* Will "extend HTML's syntax"
* "Handles all of the DOM and AJAX glue code you once wrote by hand and puts it in a well-defined structure"
* Is "opinionated about how a CRUD application should be built"
* Comes with "Data-binding, basic templating directives, form validation, routing, deep-linking, reusable components and dependency injection"
* "Angular simplifies application development by presenting a higher level of abstraction to the developer"
* "Not every app is a good fit for Angular. Angular was built with the CRUD application in mind."
* "Angular is built around the belief that declarative code is better than imperative when it comes to building UIs and wiring software components together, while imperative code is excellent for expressing business logic."

## Angular 2 Disclaimer

*Why are we not focusing on [Angular 2](https://github.com/angular/angular) but rather [Angular 1.x](https://github.com/angular/angular.js)?*

* The **features** offered in Angular 2 are not radically different.
* (As of the writing of this) Angular 1.x is well supported/active on Github.
* [Angular 2 was just released](https://splintercode.github.io/is-angular-2-ready/) and community adoption is still in progress.
* Angular 2 is best to use with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and we haven't taught TypeScript yet.
* Overall, it is much more important to **appreciate the problems** that we are solving on the client-side rather than memorizing specific solutions.

>Other frameworks tackle the same problems (i.e. maintaining state) in different, interesting ways. There is still no "silver-bullet" client-side web framework, but rather a plethora of options each offering a unique perspective and toolset. Some of these technologies include: Ember, React, Redux, Elm, Riot, Backbone, Polymer, etc. [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) is a site that presents examples of a simple "Todo" app written in a number of these technologies helping to compare and contrast them.

<!-- Half-mast then catchup -->

## Bower

[Bower](http://bower.io/) is a **package manager for *front-end* dependencies**. Install or update it with:

```bash
npm install -g bower
```

Just like npm, Bower is a handy way to install files locally, but also gives us a convenient way to share our project code with other developers without needing to send along tons of third-party libraries using a `bower.json` file.

<!--What does `bower.json` remind you of?-->

## HTML Setup

>Disclaimer: For the moment we will focus on writing Angular that simply works in an understandable way. At the end of this document, you will find a link to a style-guide that will suggest certain ways to refactor our code.

Create a new directory `ngFun`, inside initialize bower with `bower init` and hit enter a bunch of times to have it generate a `bower.json` file.

Pull down angular with bower with `bower install --save angular`.

Create a new file `index.html` and link your html file to angular `<script type="text/javascript" src="bower_components/angular/angular.js"></script>`.

In your HTML try changing the `<body>` to `<body ng-app>`. This will tell your HTML page to use angular.

Create an empty `app.js` file in your root folder and require it in your `<head>` after angular.

Let's name our app `ngFun`. To do this we can create an empty angular module.

app.js

```js
var app = angular.module("ngFun", []);
```

Now update your `body` element to `<body ng-app="ngFun">`.

Great, we're up and running!

<!--1:55 10 minutes -->

## Templates & Expressions

Angular creates its views by templating directly into HTML with expressions. This is its declarative way of building the UI.

Let's write a regular javascript expression inside double curly brackets, such as: `{{ __someExpression__ }}` and see what your HTML evaluates to, for example: `{{ 4 * 4 }} `.

<!--2:02 when turning over to devs WDI3 (skipped ngFun and app.js piece, came back later)-->

<!--Actually 2:10 -->

<!--Turn over to devs and explain you only need to tweak index.html for now--will only tweak app.js and index.html in this class -->

<!--2:13 WDI3 -->

### Challenge

* Try printing out the product `3 * 4` with the notation described above.
* Take the string `"hola!"` and call a method on it that uppercases all the letters.
* Take the array `['s','w','e','e','t','n','e','s','s']` and call a method on it that joins all the letters together.

<!--Actually 2:15 WDI2 -->
<!--2:16 WDI3 -->
<!--2:05 15 minutes -->

<!-- Review Model, View, Controller -->

## Controllers & Scope

Controllers contain all the business logic for our application.

We can seed our application with some data, but first we have to create a controller.

**app.js**

```js
app.controller("PokemonController", function() {
	//logic here
});
```

Most applications will have several controllers that map to a particular resource. In this case we're using Pokemon.

To use our controller in our View we have to declare it somewhere. Create a new `div` tag that will house our Pokemon Controller.

**index.html**

```html
<div ng-controller="PokemonController">
	<!--placeholder for now-->
</div>
```

In order to pass data or behavior to our HTML view we need to use the `$scope` object. `$scope` is Angular's interface to pass data and behavior to our views. Both the View and Controller share access to the `$scope` object.

![scope](http://devgirl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/concepts-controller.png)

Let's register some Pokemon with `$scope`! In order to use the `$scope` object, we need to explicitly pass it to our controller. This is known as [**dependency injection**](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di).

**app.js**

```js
app.controller("PokemonController", function($scope){
  $scope.pokemon = [
    {
      Ndex: 25,
      name: 'Pikachu',
      type: 'Electric'
    },
    {
      Ndex: 10,
      name: 'Caterpie',
      type: 'Bug'
    },
    {
      Ndex: 39,
      name: 'Jigglypuff',
      type: 'Fairy'
    },
    {
      Ndex: 94,
       name: 'Gengar',
      type: 'Ghost'
    },
    {
      Ndex: 143,
      name: 'Snorlax',
      type: 'Normal'
    }
  ];
});
```

Great, now let's see if we can see them in our view by referencing the `pokemon` variable inside an expression and wrapping it in a `pre` tag.

**index.html**

```html
<div ng-controller="PokemonController">
	<pre>{{ pokemon }}</pre>
</div>
```

That's cool, but it doesn't look very great. What if we could format our data so that the View knows to render it as JSON?

<!--2:24 when turning over to devs (pre-challenge) WDI3 -->

### Challenge

* Use an Angular [filter](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/filter) to render the data as JSON! Here is a [list](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/filter) of options you can implement.

* Pass a new variable `catchphrase` from the Controller to the View. Set its value as "gotta catch 'em all!" and use an angular filter to uppercase it in the View.

<!--2:20 15 minutes -->

## Directives

In Angular, we **add behavior to HTML** through [directives](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive). A directive is a marker on an HTML tag that tells Angular to run or reference Angular code. We will go into this in more detail later, but you've already used several!

Angular directives start with the prefix `ng-`

A few we already know:

`ng-app` turns ordinary HTML into an Angular application.

`ng-controller` registers a controller for a section of our application.

A few worth introducing:

`ng-model` binds an HTML element's value to a model.

`ng-repeat` iterates over a collection.

### ng-Model

Our user wants to be able to *input* their name in a field so that the application acknowledges them as the trainer for these Pokemon.

Above our list of Pokemon, but still inside our `PokemonController` `div` tag, let's create an input field for our trainer's name.

**index.html**

```html
  <div ng-controller="PokemonController">
  	...
    <span>Enter your name:</span>
    <input/>
    
    <pre>{{ pokemon | json }}</pre>
    
  </div>
```

If we want our input field to map its value to an attribute `name` on a `trainer` object we could add an `ng-model` directive to it.

```html
<input ng-model="trainer.name"/>
```

Additionally if we want the value of the `trainer.name` variable to be printed onto our page in an `h1` tag, we can reference it in an expression, such that our HTML looks like:

```html
  <div ng-controller="PokemonController">
  	...
    <h1>Trainer: {{trainer.name}}</h1>
    
    <span>Enter your name:</span>
    <input ng-model="trainer.name"/>
	...
  </div>
```

<!--2:47 WDI3 -->

### Challenge

* How could we create a default value for the trainer's name so that when the page loads it is set to `Ash`?

<!--Actually 3:05 (after 10 minute break) -->
<!-- 3:06 WDI3 -->

<!--2:35 15 minutes -->

### ng-repeat

`ngRepeat` is a very useful directive for iterating through a collection to render each item.

For example if we wanted to render a list of todos we could set the directive `ng-repeat` to equal `"todo in todos"`.

<!-- What is this like in plain JS? -->

Let's say we want to print out an unordered list (`ul`) of many pokemon, where each of their names is printed out inside a list item (`li`). Given we've agreed to use `poke` as the singular form of `pokemon`, we could say something along the lines of:

```html
<ul>
	<li ng-repeat="poke in pokemon">{{poke.name}}</li>
</ul>
```

### Challenge

Render all the Pokemon into a bootstrap table, where each attribute is a column. The final result should look like this:

![pokemon-table](http://i.imgur.com/or1CwF7.png)

>**Hint:** `bower install --save bootstrap-css-only`, use a `<table>` with the classes `"table table-striped"`.  Don't forget to `<link>` Bootstrap in your HTML file either.  If you are not sure of the `<table>` syntax, Google is your best friend.

<!--3:20 WDI3 -->

### etc

There are many more directives. For now, know that they exist and why they may be useful. Beyond that, reference the documentation. You can find a comprehensive list [here](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive). By now, you should know that looking things up as needed is a better strategy than attempting to memorize everything by heart.

<!--2:50 Break to 3:00 -->

<!--3:23 WDI3 -->

<!--3:00 5 minutes -->

### Challenge

* Sort the Pokemon by nDex number (hint: look at the built-in angular filters, and include in your `ng-repeat`).
* Create an input tag so that I can search for a particular Pokemon (hint: checkout the `filter` filter in combination with an `ng-model`).

<!--3:33 WDI3-->
<!--3:05 10 minutes -->

## Custom Filters

We've been notified that there is a new set of Pokemon in an alternate universe consisting of arch-nemeses. Pikachu's arch nemesis is Uhcakip, while Snorlax's is Xalrons (the reverse name).

First, Angular doesn't have a built-in `reverse` filter, so let's create one.

**app.js**

```js
app.filter('reverse', function() {
  return function(input) {
    input = input || '';
    var out = input.split("").reverse().join("");
    // uppercase only first letter
    out = out.toLowerCase();
    out = out[0].toUpperCase() + out.slice(1);
    return out;
  };
});
```

*Note: filters require a function to be returned.*

<!--3:38 WDI3 -->

### Challenge

* Create a new column in your table called "Nemesis" and populate it with that pokemon's name reversed.

<!--3:48 WDI3 -->
<!-- 3:15 5 minutes -->

## Pro-tip: Minification in Angular

Remember the main goal in [minification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming)) is to save space and deliver the file quickly. A variable `myVariableName` may be renamed to `a` during minification. A computer doesn't care what the name is as long as they are consistent.

However, if you ever minify your angular code when delivering it to a client your variables will be renamed and this may cause problems because of this variable renaming. Currently, we're used to seeing code like this.

```js
app.controller("PokemonController", function() {
  //...
});
```

To allow the minifier to rename the function parameters and have them still map to the correct injected services, we need to explicitly `$inject` the parameters we want into our controller as strings, which importantly do not get minified (only variables do).

```js
app.controller('PokemonController', PokemonController);
PokemonController.$inject = ['$scope'];
function PokemonController($scope) {
  //...
};
```

Again, while our parameters will get minified, the strings will not. The names of parameters are therefore preserved in the strings so that the injector can still them up as dependencies appropriately.

<!--3:20 5 minutes -->

## Our Style Guide

There are many (too many) ways to do the same thing in Angular. As a result it is best for a working-group to define a style-guide amongst themselves in order to define some convention: [here's ours](https://github.com/den-materials/angular-style-guide).

Note: It is more important to have working code than to strictly follow the style-guide. Feel free to break the style-guide's convention if the the logic can be defended.
